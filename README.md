# Sportify
Sportify is a web application that connects sports enthusiasts through meetups and discussions. 

## Motivation

The motivation for this project is to create a platform that addresses a common problem faced by university students who love sports - **the difficulty of finding people to play with**. As sports enthusiasts ourselves, we often find it difficult to gather our friends to play together. Some might be busy, far from the location, or not feeling well. However, if we can invite a large number of people to play, we will surely find someone to play with.

  

Our goal is to bridge this gap by developing a social media platform that connects students who share a love for sports and enables them to not only effectively arrange meetups and engage in sports activities, but also interact with each other through sports topics.

  

## Aim

The aim of this project is to create a user-friendly and interactive web application that **connects people who share a passion for sports**. Our goal is to make the process of organizing and participating in sports activities easier and more efficient, in other words ease the process of finding people to play with while also making new friends who share the same hobby. Additionally, the platform will allow users to create small posts and comments so that users can interact with each other on various topics.
